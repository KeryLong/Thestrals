    <h1>Networking app requirements</h1></h1>
    <p>On my spreadsheet I listed numerous tech/small business/entrepreneur events. </p>
    <P>The spreadsheet Debbie mentioned can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WSscGRv5Bnu3GQKT57OzBc3EdoNPCirui6ai0Gb2So/edit?usp=sharing">here on my Google Drive</a></P>

<p>Yes I would want an admin page to log into and manage events.</p>


<p>Here are some of my thoughts about the project</p>

<p>These events are currently listed on Eventbrite, Showpass, Meetup or individual organizations websites. What it comes down to is a person has to know where to look to find these events because they are scattered in so many places. </p>

<ol>
<li>I believe meetup.com has an API. So there must be a way to pick certain events that automatically populate to this central calendar.</li>
<li>Eventbrite and Showpass - Take RainforestAB for an example. On Eventbrite you are able to follow companies. Is there a way once RainforestAB puts an event on Evenbrite is there a way to automatically populate it into the central calendar.</li>
<li>I know Startup Calgary has a great central calendar on their website.....but I know there is still tons of events they are missing. </li>
</ol>


<p>I don't have any other idea's of what I would like to see on this project. </p>
